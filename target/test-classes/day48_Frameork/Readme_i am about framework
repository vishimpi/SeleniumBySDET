Automation Framework
----------------------

what is an automation framework
=> * where we organize automation project files/folder in structure manners 
     that is nothing but the framework.
   * by using framework its very easy to read, maintain and reuse code.
   * Objective
     1. Re-usability
     2. Maintainability- easy to modify
     3. Readability - everyone should able to learn and understand
     
what are the different type of framework?
=> there are two type of framework
   1. Built-in 
      Ex - testNG, Junit, cucumber, robot etc...
      
   2. Customized (user defined)
      EX - modular, data driven, keyword driven, hybrid driven etc...

phases/stages
-------------      
1. Analyze Application Under Test (AUT)
   * how many web pages = according to that we will split them into team
   * what are all Element/ how/ type 
   * what to automate/ what we can not automate?
     => from application perspective we decide weather automate or not

2. How to Choose test cases for Automation?
=> 100 TC --- 90 automatable 10 can not automate
   so here if u automate all au tomatable TC (90) its mean 100% automation achieve
   
   1. sanity test cases - P1
   2. data driven test cases/ re-test - P2
   3. Regression TC - P3 
   4. Other TC - P4
   
3. Design & Development of framework
=> Design - it mean the folder structure u follow
          - generally senior people do this design kind of thing
           
   Development - it mean we add code    
   
4. Execution
=> Local - on my local system i run code
   Remotely - I push code in remote repo then by taking that 
   code i run it on some other machine like jenkins
   
5. Maintenance
=> we will have the code in common place = remote repo.

Application divide in 2 part

1. FrontEnd
=> Register, login, search, add/edit/delete to cart, checkout, review etc...  
               
2. BackEnd (means only backEnd team can do this activity)
=> Products, customers, orders, store etc...
